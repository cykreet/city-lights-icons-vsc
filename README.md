| This is an unofficial fork of the [City Lights](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Yummygum.city-lights-icon-vsc) icon pack, mainly for the reasons that the original extension is missing some icons and hasn't been updated in quite a while. This fork removes some features - like toggling folder icons, along with fixing vscode web IDE support. |
